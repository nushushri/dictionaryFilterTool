# dictionaryFilterTool

This is a tool designed off of my love for Wordle (though I have no association with the game). Simply open up a Python interpreter with the program.py file, pop open Wordle side-by-side, enter guesses into Wordle, and report the outcomes (correct and incorrect letters and their positions) into the pop-up window. The program will print out possible candidate words after each guess. 

Enjoy!

Note: This program uses a dictionary obtained from https://github.com/dwyl/english-words . Specifically, I duplicated the "words_alpha.txt" file from that repo. I then extracted all of the 5-letter words into a text file called "fiveLetterOnly.txt".
